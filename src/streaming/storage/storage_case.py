"""src/streaming/storage/storage_case.py.

Project-specific DuckDB storage functions
used by the Kafka consumer.

This project persists consumed Kafka messages to disk
so they can be queried, counted, and analyzed while the consumer runs.
Without storage, all consumed data is lost when the consumer stops.

This module creates two DuckDB tables:
  - consumed_valid_sales: records that passed all validation checks
  - consumed_rejected_sales: records that failed, with error details attached

For each consumed message the consumer calls:
  1. create_storage_tables() once at startup to initialize the tables.
  2. clear_storage_tables() once at startup to reset from any prior run.
  3. write_valid_record() or write_rejected_record() for each message.
  4. log_storage_summary() at the end to report what was stored.

The generic SQL builders (CREATE, DELETE, INSERT) come from
datafun_streaming.storage.duckdb_sql and work with any table.
The domain-specific table names and field lists are defined here.

This module is specific to our sales data and consumer application,
but the overall structure can be adapted for other types of streaming data.

Other ideas for domain-specific storage include:
  - Add a table for enriched records with derived fields (subtotal, tax, total).
  - Store a running count per region to track which regions are busiest.
  - Add a summary table that stores one row per consumer run with totals.
  - Store reference data (regions, products) in DuckDB for SQL-based lookups.
  - Add a table for messages that timed out or had Kafka delivery errors.

  Don't edit this file - it should remain a working example.
  Copy it, rename it storage_yourname.py,
